 * \class AGGameDataMap
 * An in-memory representation of the current state of a game's
 * Whispersync data. This data structure is organized as a map of strings
 * to containers where each container is a specific syncable type. The
 * syncable types that are supported are: highest number, lowest number,
 * latest number, highest number list, lowest number list, accumulating
 * number, latest string, latest string list, string set, and game data
 * maps (for nested maps). When the GameDataMap is populated or updated
 * with a new value of each syncable type, that value is automatically
 * synchronized with data stored locally on the device and in the cloud.
