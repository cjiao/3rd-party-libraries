 * \protocol AGSyncableList
 * A syncable type that represents a list of fixed numbers.  The list has
 * a configurable max size, and is typically used to represent a top N list
 * of highest numbers or lowest numbers across multiple devices. The 
 * aforementioned N can be set by setting the capacity of the list. This
 * capacity cannot exceed AGSyncableListMaximumCapacity. AGSyncableLists 
 * start with a default capacity of AGSyncableListDefaultCapacity. Examples
 * are top 10 scores and top 10 fastest times.  Note that metadata cannot
 * be associated with this type, but metadata can be associated with each of
 * its elements.
